I researched on how student workers are exploited within their campus workplace environment and how it corresponds to the university’s responsibility. As academic workers across University of California schools strike for a fair contract against unfair labor practices, the student workers of minimum wage service jobs with more physical labor conditions, such as at food courts, bookstores, or transportation services, have the same sentiments but less competency to reach a fair bargain. The basis of understanding exploitation is gathered through Michael Yates’s Why Unions Matter on how “the most fundamental aspect of work is not controlled by us” because “employers try to organize their workplaces so that we cannot exert much control by our own actions” (p.8). After conducting an interview with a student worker from Boston College's bookstore, I proposed that student workers are exploited through the manipulation of their hours and physical well being because of the disparities in labor relations and the institutionalized structure of universities that perpetuates the extremities of stratification.
